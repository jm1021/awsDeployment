# awsDeployment
Automated deployment for my AWS CSA machines using shell scripts.

# NOTE:
## This is **heavily** WIP. Nothing is in a usable state as of now.

# Installation (WIP)
Clone this repo to the machine you want to deploy on:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/michaelScopic/awsDeployment
```

Then cd into the repo:
```sh
cd awsDeployment
```

Now lets set everything up with `setup.sh`:
```sh
./setup.sh
```

**WIP**
